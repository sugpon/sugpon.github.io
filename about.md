# About Me

I'm Suganya Ponnusamy â€” an IT professional with a passion for software development and a keen interest in coding. With a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and React, Iâ€™ve built a diverse portfolio of projects that reflect both my technical ability and my dedication to continuous learning.

From resolving production issues in global banking systems to building hands-on projects through LaunchCodeâ€™s full-time software development course, my journey has blended real-world experience with self-driven learning and adaptability.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™ve led nonprofit initiatives, organized cultural events, and launched a small business â€” each of which has shaped my collaborative, solution-oriented mindset.
