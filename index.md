# IT Professional & Developer

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m an IT professional with experience in application support, incident management, and resolving production issues in mission-critical banking systems. I recently graduated from LaunchCode’s full-time software development program, where I built hands-on projects using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and React.

I’ve worked in both Level 1 and 2 support roles, performing root cause analysis, triaging incidents, and managing SLAs in ITIL-aligned environments. I’m comfortable navigating Linux systems, writing SQL queries, and collaborating in Agile teams using tools like Jira and GitHub.

## What I Can Do
- Application Support (L1 & L2, Production)
- Java + Spring Boot Development
- SQL & MySQL Database Querying
- React, HTML, CSS (Front-End Basics)
- Ticketing Systems, ITIL Practices
- Git, GitHub, and Version Control

## What I’m Looking For
I'm actively seeking entry-level opportunities across application support, software development, QA/testing, or technical coordination. I’m open to a variety of IT-friendly roles where I can contribute, continue learning, and grow within a collaborative team. At this stage, my goal is to get a meaningful start, to solve real problems, prove my capabilities, and build a long-term career.
