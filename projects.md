# My Project

## Yuvathees Wardrobe (Official Brand Website)
Yuvathees Wardrobe is a well-established Indian ethnic wear brand offering a diverse collection of traditional and contemporary sarees, readymades, and handwoven treasures paired with an imitation jewelry line accentuating the beauty of Indian attire. Serving a growing international customer base, the brand is known for authentic craftsmanship, custom tailoring, and a personalized customer experience delivered through strong social media engagement.

This project involved developing a clean, elegant, and user-friendly single-page React web application deployed on Netlify, designed to:

- Showcase the brandâ€™s rich heritage, diverse offerings, and values on a polished digital platform.

- Streamline customer communication by providing comprehensive brand information and reducing repetitive inquiries.

- Enable seamless navigation with persistent header and footer for easy browsing.

- Incorporate a contact form and WhatsApp integration for direct customer engagement.

- Ensure a fully responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid for optimal experience on all devices.

This project highlights my ability to translate brand identity into an engaging and functional web presence, combining front-end development skills with UX best practices. In the next phase, it will be further developed using a backend built with Java and Spring Boot, connected to local databases to store customer information. The goal is to evolve it into a fully functional website with customer-centric, personalized pages and login functionality.

Technologies Used: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
